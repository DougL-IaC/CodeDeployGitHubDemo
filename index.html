	<h1 text-align:center;>Terraform Forever After Volume 1</h1> 
		<p> 
		Oh, you're here. Come on, sit down and relax while I walk you through my adventures of the wild wild Terraform. Now, this journey was over the course of 
		two very treacherous days where Terraform done did the stoopid and bullied me every step of the way and even now we still butt heads but it gucci. Now let's
		get started with this journey!
		</p>
	<h2> The Start of Day One </h2>
		<p>
		I had started learning about Terraform and was beginning to understand it. I was ready to take it on.

	<h2> The End of Day One </h2> 
		<p>
		After going through documentation, videos, trial and error, my perspective of Terraform at the end of the day changed completely.

	<h2> Day Two Start </h2> 
		<p>
		I was petrified of it after spending the day going through information and trying to make something work. After failing, I could only imagine the pain that
		would result from today's journey.

	<h2> Middle of Day Two </h2> 
		<p>
		There where so many things that had gone wrong. Terraform continued to bully and yell at me for everything I did.

	<h2> The End of Day Two </h2>
		<p>
		Although terraform has not stopped bullying me, even now, after all we've been through together, we've learned to work around our issues. We have 
		learned how to better our communication, and more importantly, we have learned each other's advantages and disadvantages and how to overcome each 
		other's weaknesses. At the start of this journey Terraform humiliated me every step of the way, but now the roles have changed.  At the end of this
		day I have succedded in making Terraform bend and work to my every command. I am now the one in power! I am now the one humiliating him!! I am the
		one who has won this war!!! The last video is the most accurate description of me at this time. I thank you for listening to the story of Terraform 
		Forever After. The End (for now until mr.p tells me to do something else with it)
